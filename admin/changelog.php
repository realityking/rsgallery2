---------------- 2.2.1 ------- svn 1044 -- 2011-09-19 -------------

2011-09-19 Mirjam - SVN 1042/1043

# Corrected path to galleries.item.xml file for gallery parameters. 

2011-01-28 Mirjam - SVN 1013
+ Added SEF option: advanced SEF with using aliases that don't need to be unique since the id's are used as well. There are three 'Advanced SEF' options now: no, yes, yes... where the third is the new option.
# Adjusted pathway so that item name is only added when item is shown
^ Bumped version number to 2.2.1 (to allow db update for alias)

2011-01-26 Mirjam
# Fixed "Notice: Array to string conversion in /.../administrator/components/com_rsgallery2/includes/config.class.php on line 182"

# Corrected pathway: show correct gallery, depending on menulink, and added item to pathway.
# (De)installation now uses RSGallery2's language files: strings are translatable

2010-11-18 Mirjam
+ Added license tag to manifest.

2010-10-25 Mirjam - SVN 995
# Backend list of items showed all items instead of number set in Joomla's Global Config. [#23214]
+ In backend view of all galleries an image is added that links to the backend view of images, filtered on that gallery.
# Instead of the fi-FI language fr-FR was installed: corrected.

---------------- 2.2.0 ------- svn 993 -- 2010-11-04 -------------

2010-10-25 Mirjam - SVN 992
! When using JoomFish and Joomla SEF the message that a gallery/image name is not unique is given even when the gallery/image does exist with a unique name. This problem is not solved, but the error messages are improved: JoomFish does not return which gallery/image is used so a 'gallery/image not found' message is shown instead of a 'gallery/image not unique' message.
# RSG2 now handles galleries with an ' in the name, when Joomla SEF is used.

2010-10-20 Mirjam
! Domain rsgallery2.net was lost to the RSGallery2 Team in september 2010.
  SVN and File Releases are still on http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/rsgallery2
  where packages now show j10 for Joomla!1.0 and j15 for Joomla!1.5.
^ New domain www.rsgallery2.nl will be used from now on, changed in the code.
^ New mailaddress will be used: team@rsgallery2.nl instead of info@rsgallery2.net.
  (Note: support goes through the forum, not by e-mail!)


2010-10-20 Mirjam
# Order/reorder in Backend Galleries now works correctly and reorder images show only when they can be used
^ Manifest rsgallery2.xml now used method="upgrade" so uninstalling RSG2 and revisiting its menu-items after installation is no longer neccessary. It writes over all existing files mentioned in the xml, so backing up of any file changes, e.g. to the existing template, is needed.

2010-08-22 Mirjam - SVN 989
^ Updated german and french language file (thanks to GÃ¼nter Hoffman)

2010-05-20 Mirjam - SVN 986

2010-04-09 Mirjam - SVN 985
# Changed all Help buttons to JToolBarHelper::help( 'screen.rsgallery2',true); and moved the screen.rsgallery2.html file to the correct folder /help/en-GB/ to be accessable: now all Help buttons are functional with updated information.

2010-03-30 Mirjam - SVN 983
+ Added menutree option to choose gallery tied to the menu item from list of galleries, including root gallery
# Changed router.php to correctly get gid when menuitem shows (sub)gallery and not rootgallery (otherwise resulting in hit() error)
+ Updated rsgallery2.xml to include views directory (thus now also installing Jonahs display-view from SVN955, but hidden through the metadata.xml settings)

2010-03-17 Mirjam - SVN 982
# Added if !defined('JPATH_RSGALLERY2_ADMIN'){} to avoid notice because when SEF is used this constant is defined in two places

2010-03-13 Mirjam - SVN 981
# Fix on resize of portrait images with DB: GD::resize portrait images now based on input $targetWidth, 
	not on display size (before svn 965) or thumb size (since 965). 
# Small fixes in function createImages() in maintenance.php.

---------------- 2.1.1 ------- svn 978 -- 2010-03-04 -------------

2010-03-02 Mirjam - SVN 976
^ Changed use of PEAR_Error to JError::raiseNotice and return false instead of new PEAR_Error (PEAR_Error is PHP4 not PHP5 and deprecated in Joomla 1.6)
# Backend display item moved inside 'case item->type' for image: was error for type mp3
+ Added JText language strings for error handling

2010-02-26 Mirjam - SVN 975

	or in store() of object
! Item and gallery descriptions are in JREQUEST_ALLOWRAW format

2010-02-18 Mirjam - SVN 968
# Ability to edit and delete galleries fixed in frontend My Galleries - use gid not catid
! gallery list to choose from is unaware of which user is logged on, function galleryUtils::galleriesSelectList is used for front- and backend

2010-02-16 Mirjam - SVN 967
# filenames with spaces were not allowed when regenerating proportional images with GD2
# portrait images were not resized according to thumb_width (it used image width) - fixed
! proportional resizing uses thumb_width for max width and height

2010-02-15 Mirjam
+ Added and changed language strings that were hardcoded instead of JText: en-GB and nl-NL
# upgrade now possible without legacy turned on - changed getting db-prefix

2008-12-12 John Caprez
+ video functionality 
  mov,flv and avi files can be uploaded. 
  To be able to convert video files a conversion application must be set up.
  The converter is not part of the RSGallery2 package.
  The predefined settings are for the ffmpeg converter (http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/)
  To display the videos the open source flv player is used (http://www.osflv.com/)
